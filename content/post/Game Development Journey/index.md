# PREFACE
I started Unity Development in 2016 and continued until 2019. From then on I was
not able to work as I used to. I lost the interest in What I loved. Reason? Even
as I am writing this I still find it hard to express in words alone. Not being
able to pin point one cause for this. Albit the mistake is all my own doing, and
reactions I gave to the circumstances at that time.
